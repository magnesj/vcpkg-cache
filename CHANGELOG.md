## [3.4.1] - [#14](https://github.com/TAServers/vcpkg-cache/pull/14)

### Fixed

- Fixed error when no caches had been generated on the current branch (when distinct from the default)
- Fixed bug where only the first cache from the current branch was used

## [3.4.0] - [#11](https://github.com/TAServers/vcpkg-cache/pull/11)

### Added

- Fetch existing cache entries from the default branch, in addition to those created on derived branches

## [3.3.1] - [#9](https://github.com/TAServers/vcpkg-cache/pull/9)

### Fixed

- Fixed not filtering cache entries by branch ref - Wasn't released previously as /dist needed regenerating

## [3.3.0] - [#8](https://github.com/TAServers/vcpkg-cache/pull/8)

### Fixed

- Fixed not filtering cache entries by branch ref

## [3.2.0] - [#6](https://github.com/TAServers/vcpkg-cache/pull/6)

### Added

- Optional input to override the cache key prefix

## [3.1.0] - [No PR](#)

### Fixed

## [3.0.0] - [No PR](#)

### Added

- Added `path` output containing the absolute path of the archive folder to be passed to vcpkg

- Removed `archive-path` input to take the burden of GHA cache edge cases off of the user

## [2.2.0] - [No PR](#)

### Changed

- Changed cache key to prefix using the archive path (key is now just the filename). This is needed due to GitHub
  versioning caches with the same key using their file path, causing silently failing cache restores when changing
  `archive-path`
